# BLOOM-smart-contract-


1. Write a smart contract for a token ([ERC20 or ERC721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/tokens)). The owner of the contract should be able to mint new tokens.
Build a frontend dapp that allows the contract owner to mint new tokens and shows the balances (or tokens held) of all users.


>  A token is a representation of something in the blockchain.
